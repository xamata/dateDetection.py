# dateDetection.py
Code I created Chapter 7 Personal Projects.
A dateDetection.py file that uses regex and pyperclip to sift through a message and grabs the valid dates in DD/MM/YYYY format. 
The valid dates are copied to your clipboard and ready to be printed.

The implementation of my code is laughable, and I'm not sure just yet of how to make this code more efficient.
It felt as if new bandaids were being piled on, not bandaids. I'm not sure how much of that bandaid work is being done in the industry, but I'm excited to learn how to fully repair my code and to improve it with the right tools.  
All of my projects will be milestones to look back and see how far I've come.
